      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vivekanand Pratishthan is a sacred
      center in the field of education. We extend a heartfelt welcome to all parents. The foundation
      of a child's physical, mental, and social development is laid during early childhood, that is,
      from birth to six years of age. During this period, 70% of mental development and 40% of
      physical development takes place. How a child will lead life in the future largely depends on
      the family environment. Therefore the atmosphere at home should be supportive and nurturing
      for a child's proper development. <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
      short, if the foundation of a child's development during early childhood is strong, a balanced
      personality will be formed. Hence, do not rush to make children grow up by taking away their
      childhood. Avoid saying that you do not have time for your own child. Instead, provide your
      child with nutritious food, love, care, protection and quality time, and have faith in them -
      everything will fall into place naturally.
